## Learning planner

This is a web-based application developed using HTML, SCSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, designed to aid in the organization of learning activities. The application allows users to create categories such as "Spanish Language" or "Programming," and add tasks to each category, specifying the amount of time they want to spend on each task, such as "20 minutes for verbs" or "5 minutes for vocabulary."

The primary benefit of using this application is improved organization, which helps learners stay on track with their studies and achieve their learning goals.
