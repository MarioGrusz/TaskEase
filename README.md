TaskEase is a web-based application developed using HTML, SCSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It is designed to aid in the organization of learning activities. Users can create customized categories such as "Spanish Language" or "Programming," empowering them to allocate specific time intervals to individual tasks, such as "20 minutes for verbs" or "5 minutes for vocabulary."
